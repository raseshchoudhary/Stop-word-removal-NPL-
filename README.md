Whenever we communicate there are certain words which are not important and the listner can understand the speaker even without using those words, such words are called stop words.

# What has been performed?

In this file I have create a python function that will take a sentence as an input, remove the stop words from the sentence and return the sentence after removing all the stop words.

1. Tokenized the sentence, to conver the sentence into words

2. Created a for look to go word by word and check whether the word is there in the lost of stop words or not.

3. If the words is a part of stop words in the python library then the function will skip it.

4. The result is the same sentence with all the stop words omitted.
